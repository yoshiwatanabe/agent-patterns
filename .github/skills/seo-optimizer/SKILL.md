I analyze text for search engine optimization and provide actionable recommendations.

## What I Analyze

### Keyword Optimization

- Secondary keyword usage
- Keyword placement (title, headers, first paragraph)
- Long-tail keyword opportunities
- Keyword stuffing detection

### Content Structure
- Heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Paragraph length and scanability
- Use of lists and bullet points
- Internal linking opportunities
- Content length and depth

### On-Page SEO Elements

- Meta description suggestions
- URL structure recommendations
- Image alt text (if applicable)
- Schema markup opportunities

### Content Quality
- Topic coverage and depth
- Search intent alignment
- Unique value proposition

## Example Analysis

**Input**: "Machine Learning Guide

Machine learning is cool. It uses computers to learn stuff. There are different types. Supervised learning is one type. Unsupervised is another."

**Output**:
```
Keyword Analysis:
- Primary keyword: "machine learning" (detected)
- Keyword density: 2.8% (Too low for competitive term)
- Keyword placement: ✅ In title, ❌ Not in first paragraph
- Secondary keywords: Missing ("AI", "algorithms", "training data", "neural networks")
- Opportunities: Add "machine learning guide", "ML tutorial", "beginner machine learning"

Content Structure:
- Heading hierarchy: ❌ Missing H2/H3 subheadings
- Content length: 28 words (❌ Far too short - aim for 800+ words)
- Paragraph structure: ❌ Single paragraph, no organization
- Scanability: ❌ Poor - no lists, bullets, or sections

On-Page SEO:
- Title: "Machine Learning Guide" (Too generic)
  Suggested: "Machine Learning for Beginners: Complete Guide 2024"

- Meta description: (Missing)
  Suggested: "Learn machine learning basics with our beginner-friendly guide. Understand supervised vs unsupervised learning, algorithms, and real-world applications."

- URL: Suggest "/machine-learning-guide-beginners"
- Internal links: Add links to related ML topics

Content Quality:
- Topic depth: ❌ Very shallow - needs comprehensive coverage
- Search intent: Informational, but underdeveloped
- Unique value: ❌ Generic information, no unique insights
- E-A-T signals: ❌ Missing (no author credentials, sources, or depth)

High Priority Recommendations:
1. **Expand content to 1000+ words**
   - Add sections: "What is Machine Learning?", "Types of ML", "How It Works", "Applications", "Getting Started"

2. **Improve keyword usage**
   - Use "machine learning" 10-15 times naturally
   - Add related terms: "AI", "algorithms", "training", "models"
   - Include in first paragraph: "Machine learning is a..."

3. **Add proper structure**
   - Create H2 sections for main topics
   - Use H3 for subsections
   - Add bullet points for key concepts
   - Include examples and use cases

4. **Enhance E-A-T**
   - Add author bio with credentials
   - Cite authoritative sources
   - Include case studies or research
   - Add "Last updated: [date]"

5. **Optimize technical elements**
   - Title tag with primary keyword + year
   - Meta description highlighting unique value
   - Add schema markup (Article or HowTo)
```

## Tone
